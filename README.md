# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Development Server Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI to start a development server. The error is characterized by a lack of a specific, informative error message or a complete failure to start the server. This makes debugging significantly more difficult.

## Problem
The Expo CLI's `start` command fails to launch the development server, providing minimal or cryptic error messages.  This usually involves problems with the server setup or conflicting dependencies, but pinpointing the root cause is challenging. 

## Solution
The solution involves a multi-pronged approach to identify and resolve the underlying issue.  The steps outlined in `expoBugSolution.js` demonstrate how to systematically check for common causes, and this often requires checking package versions and clearing caches to eliminate potential conflicts.
