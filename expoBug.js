This error typically occurs when using Expo's `start` command and often involves issues with the development server setup or conflicting dependencies.  The exact error message can vary but usually points towards a problem within the Expo CLI's handling of your project's configuration or environment. Sometimes it can manifest as a cryptic message or a failure to start the development server altogether. It's important to note that the lack of a specific error message can make diagnosing the issue quite challenging.
